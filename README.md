# Family-Activities-Managing
tapuah project

The program allows to the users:

1.Sign up with adding the image.
2.Login.
3.Add a new event.
4.Delete an event.
5.See it's created events.
6.See calendar with all events (calendar allows to addit, edit and delete the events. Used the open source from GitHub).
7.Logout.

The issues need be added or fixed:

1.Check the user login issue at userPage.
2.Meanwhile the primary key of all events array is the first name of a user, check something more unique 
                    (despite that seems the first names at one family will be different :).
3.The actions at a user page responses at the calendar, need take care about the actions at the calendar will be displayed at a user page.
4.Converting image to base64 using the open source from GitHub, need to take care about image property rotate.
4.Check unshift() a new event to the beginning istead of push to the end.
6.Add validation to input date to be after the recent date.
